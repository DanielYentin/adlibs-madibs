# a la abstract of a scientific paper: 
* Users will have to register to use the site.
* Logged-in users can either start a new story or add to an existing story.
* When adding to a story,
    * Users are shown only the latest update to the story, not the whole thing.
    * A user can then add some amount of text to the story.
* Once a user has added to a story, they cannot add to it again.
* When creating a new story,
    * Users get to start with any amount of text and give the story a title.
    * Logged in users will be able to read any story they have contributed to on their homepage (the landing page after login).
